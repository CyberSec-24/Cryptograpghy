CAST-128, also called CAST5, is a symmetric-key block cipher having a classical 12-or 16-round Feistel network with a block size of 64 bits. 

CAST-128 uses a key size varying from 40 bits to 128 bits in 8-bit increments. 

The CAST-128 components include large 8×32-bit S-boxes (S1, S2, S3, S4) based on bent functions, modular addition and subtraction, key-dependent rotation, and XOR operations. 

CAST-128 uses a masking key (Km1) and a rotation key (Kr1) for performing its functions. 

The round function consists of three alternating types to perform addition, subtraction, or XOR operations in different stages.

It used as a default cipher in GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy).

CAST-256 is an extension of CAST-128 that uses the same design procedure. CAST-256 has a 128-bit block size and uses key sizes varying from 128 to 256 bits. 

Furthermore, it uses zero-correlation cryptanalysis, which can break 28 rounds with time = 2246.9 and data = 298.8



GOST 
Block Cipher The GOST (Government Standard) block cipher, also called Magma, is a symmetric-key block cipher having a 32-round Feistel network working on 64-bit blocks with a 256-bit key length.

It consists of an S-box that can be kept secret and it contains around 354 bits of secret information.

GOST is a simple encryption algorithm, where the round function 32-bit subkey modulo 2^32 is added and put in the layer of S-boxes and the rotate left shift operation is used for shifting 11 bits, thereby providing the output of the round function

The key scheduling of the GOST block cipher is performed by breaking the 256-bit key into eight 32-bit subkeys, where each subkey is used four times. 

In this algorithm, the key words are used in order for the first 24 rounds and they are used in reverse order for the last 8 rounds.

Kuznyechik is the latest extension of GOST, which uses 128-bit blocks



Camellia 
Camellia is a symmetric-key block cipher having either 18 rounds (for 128-bit keys) or 24 rounds (for 256-bit keys). 

It is a Feistel cipher with a block size of 128 bits and a key size of 128, 192, and 256 bits.

Camellia uses four 8×8-bit S-boxes that perform affine transformations and logical operations. 

A logical transformation layer FL-function or its inverse is applied every six rounds. Camellia uses the key whitening technique for increased security. 

Camellia is a part of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which is used to deliver secure communication. 

Camellia cannot be brute-forced even with the latest technology although it uses a smaller key size of 128 bits, thus making it a safe cipher.

In addition, Camellia offers high security and its processing skills are equivalent to those of AES or Rijndael
