MD5 Calculator is a simple application that calculates the MD5 hash of a given file. 

It can be used with large files (e.g., several gigabytes in size). It features a progress counter and a text field from which the final MD5 hash can be easily copied to the clipboard. 

MD5 Calculator can be used to check the integrity of a file. It allows you to calculate the MD5 hash value of the selected file. 

Right-click the file and choose "MD5 Calculator;" the program will calculate the MD5 hash. The MD5 Digest field contains the calculated value. 

To compare this MD5 digest with another, one can paste the other value into the Compare To field.

Obviously, an equal to sign (“=”) appears between the two values if they are equal; otherwise, the less than (“<”) or greater than (“>”) sign will tell you that the values are different


Multilayer Hashing Calculators
Multilayer hashing, also known as nested hashing or recursive hashing, is a technique in which a hash function is applied multiple times to the input or output of a previous hash operation.

This approach can enhance the security and create more complex hash structures. Tools such as CyberChef can be used to perform multilayer hashing. 

This multilayer hashing process can make it more difficult for attackers to reverse engineer the original input data from the hash value, as it adds an additional layer of complexity, which makes brute-force attacks more challenging


Working of Multilayer Hashing 
▪ Initial Hashing: The original input data (e.g., a message or file) are hashed using a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-256, SHA-3, or MD5. 
The result is a fixed-size hash value that is typically a string of characters.

▪ Subsequent Hashing: The hash value obtained from the initial hashing step is again hashed using the same or different hash functions. 
This process can be repeated several times to create multiple hashing layers.

▪ Final Hash Value: After a predetermined number of hashing iterations, the final hash value is obtained.
This value is used as the final output of the multilayer hashing process


Steps to Perform Multilayer Hashing Using CyberChef 
▪ Step 1: Create a sample file and open the CyberChef (https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef). 

▪ Step 2: Click on the "Open file as input" option to upload the sample file

▪ Step 3: Search for the desired hashing algorithm in the Operations panel (e.g., MD5), and drag and drop it into the Recipe panel. The output is shown in the Output panel.

▪ Step 4: Using the MD5 hash value as the input, select another hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA1) and drag and drop it into the Recipe panel.

▪ Step 5: Based on these requirements, select another hashing algorithm using the output of the SHA1 hash as the input and perform hashing recursively, as shown in the screenshot
