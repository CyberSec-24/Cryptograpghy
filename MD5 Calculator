MD5 Calculator is a simple application that calculates the MD5 hash of a given file. 

It can be used with large files (e.g., several gigabytes in size). It features a progress counter and a text field from which the final MD5 hash can be easily copied to the clipboard. 

MD5 Calculator can be used to check the integrity of a file. It allows you to calculate the MD5 hash value of the selected file. 

Right-click the file and choose "MD5 Calculator;" the program will calculate the MD5 hash. The MD5 Digest field contains the calculated value. 

To compare this MD5 digest with another, one can paste the other value into the Compare To field.

Obviously, an equal to sign (“=”) appears between the two values if they are equal; otherwise, the less than (“<”) or greater than (“>”) sign will tell you that the values are different
