A digital signature uses asymmetric cryptography to simulate the security properties of a signature in digital form rather than in written form.

A digital signature is a cryptographic means of authentication. Public-key cryptography uses asymmetric encryption and helps the user to create a digital signature. 

The two types of keys in public-key cryptography are the private key (only the signer knows this key and uses it to create a digital signature) and the public key (it is widely known and the relying party uses it to verify the digital signature).

A hash function is an algorithm that helps a user to create and verify a digital signature. This algorithm creates a digital representation, also known as the message fingerprint. 

This fingerprint has a hash value that is much smaller than the message, but one that is unique to it. 

If the attacker changes the message, the hash function will automatically produce a different hash value. 

To verify the digital signature, one needs the hash value of the original message and the encryption algorithm used to create the digital signature.

Using both the public key and the new result, the verifier checks to see if the digital signature was created with the related private key and whether the new hash value is the same as the original one. 

A digital signature may be further protected by encrypting the signed email for confidentiality.
