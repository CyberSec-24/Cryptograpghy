Source: https://www.cryptool.org 
The CrypTool offers a range of software tools and resources designed to carry out cryptanalysis using various cryptographic techniques and methods.

It consists of various in-built projects such as CT1, CT2, JCT, and CTO. o CrypTool 1 (CT1) – It is written in C++ and is a Windows program.

It supports classical and modern cryptographic algorithms (encryption and decryption, key generation, secure passwords, authentication, secure protocols, etc.).

It is used to perform cryptanalysis of several algorithms (Vigenère, RSA, AES, etc.)

o CrypTool 2 (CT2) – It supports visual programming GUI and execution of cascades of cryptographic procedures. It is also compatible for Windows OS.

o JCrypTool (JCT) – It allows comprehensive cryptographic experimentation on Linux, macOS, and Windows. 
It also allows users to develop and extend its platform in various ways with their own crypto plug-ins.

o CrypTool-Online (CTO) – It runs in a browser and provides a variety of encryption methods and analysis tools.
