Web of trust (WoT) is a trust model of PGP, OpenPGP, and GnuPG accessible systems. It is an idea of decentralizing the key distribution among PGP users. 

In the PKI, only centralized power such as the CA signs certificates in the network, ensuring authenticity between the public key and its owner. 

In WoT, everyone in the network is a CA, and they can sign for other trusted entities. 

WoT is a network chain in which individuals intermediately validate each other’s certificates using their signatures.

These signatures verify the ownership of keys from various trust levels. 

There is a bunch of similar trust levels through direct or indirect references in WoT


Working of WOT 
In WOT, every PGP user in the network has a ring of public keys to encrypt the data, and they introduce many other users whom they trust. 

In this trust model, a user encodes the data with the receiver’s public key that is decrypted only by the receiver’s private key.

Then, every user in this model digitally signs the data with their private keys; when the recipient is validating it against the user’s public key, he/she can confirm the user’s authenticity. 

This process will ensure that data are received from a valid user without being modified, and only the intended user can access the information, as only he/she holds the related private key
