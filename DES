DES is a standard for data encryption that uses a secret key for both encryption and decryption (symmetric cryptosystem). 

DES uses a 64-bit secret key, of which 56 bits are generated randomly and the other 8 bits are used for error detection. 

It uses a data encryption algorithm (DEA), a secret key block cipher employing a 56-bit key operating on 64-bit blocks. 

DES is the archetypal block cipher—an algorithm that takes a fixed-length string of plaintext bits and transforms it into a ciphertext bit string of the same length. 

The design of DES allows users to implement it in hardware and use it for single-user encryption, such as to store files on a hard disk in encrypted form



Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES)

Eventually, it became obvious that DES would no longer be secure. 

The U.S. Federal Government began a contest seeking a replacement cryptography algorithm. 

However, in the meantime, 3DES was created as an interim solution. 

Essentially, it performs DES three times with three different keys. 

3DES uses a “key bundle” that comprises three DES keys, K1, K2, and K3. Each key is a standard 56-bit DES key. 

It then performs the following process:
DES encrypt with K1, DES decrypt with K2, DES encrypt with K3

There are three options for the keys. In the first option, all three keys are independent and different. 

In the second option, K1 and K3 are identical. 

In the third option, all three keys are the same; therefore, you are literally applying the same DES algorithm three times with the same key.

The first option is the most secure, while the third is the least secure
