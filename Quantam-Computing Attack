1. Quantum Cryptanalysis Attack
Quantum cryptanalysis attacks leverage quantum-computing techniques to compromise cryptographic systems that can withstand classical attacks.

Quantum algorithms, such as Shor's and Grover's, allow attackers to break current encryption methods, jeopardizing the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.

In addition, these algorithms allow attackers to forge digital signatures, thereby undermining the authenticity of electronic communications and transactions.

2. Quantum Side-Channel Attack
Quantum side-channel attacks exploit information leakage from the physical implementation of quantum cryptographic systems to gather information from quantum computers without directly attacking the algorithms.

By analyzing indirect vulnerabilities such as quantum noise, error rates, timing, power consumption, and electromagnetic emissions during quantum computations or key exchanges, attackers can infer sensitive information, including cryptographic keys


3. Classical-to-Quantum Transition Attack
Classical-to-quantum transition attacks exploit vulnerabilities that arise during the transition from classical cryptographic systems to quantum-resistant systems. 

During this period, hybrid systems that combine classical and quantum cryptography may exhibit weaknesses or interoperability issues.

Attackers target these transitional systems to compromise security, intercept communication, and extract sensitive information before robust quantum-resistant protocols are fully implemented and standardized


4. Harvest-Now, Decrypt-Later Attack
The Harvest-Now, Decrypt-Later attack involves intercepting and storing encrypted data today with the intention of breaking the encryption in the future once quantum computers become powerful enough to defeat current encryption algorithms. 

Attackers capture large volumes of sensitive encrypted data from the Internet or secure communications, expecting that future quantum computing capabilities will allow them to decrypt this information, thereby compromising long-term confidentiality and security


5. Quantum Trojan Horse Attack
Quantum Trojan horse attacks involve embedding malicious quantum devices or components in a quantum cryptographic system.

These malicious elements can covertly gather and transmit sensitive information to attackers. 

By exploiting these hidden vulnerabilities, attackers can bypass the security of quantum cryptographic protocols, potentially compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the entire system without directly breaking quantum algorithms.


6. Quantum Supply Chain Attack
Quantum supply chain attacks target the quantum-computing hardware and software supply chains. 

This type of attack involves tampering with components, software, or firmware at any point in the supply chain before deployment in a quantum system. 

The goal is to introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors that can be exploited later to compromise the security and integrity of a quantum system. 

These include the addition of malicious quantum circuits or states to quantum communication systems or algorithms to create exploitable weaknesses


7. Quantum-Computer Sabotage Attack
Quantum-computer sabotage attacks involve direct physical or cyberactions aimed at disrupting or destroying quantum-computer operations.

This can include physically damaging the hardware to cause malfunctions, potentially affecting critical applications, and research that relies on advanced computational capabilities. 

Such attacks can significantly hinder the progress and deployment of quantum-computing technologies.


8. Fault-Injection Attack on Quantum Hardware
Fault-injection attacks on quantum hardware involve deliberately embedding errors or faults into a quantum system to interrupt its workflow and compromise security.

This type of attack is performed by manipulating environmental conditions, such as temperature and electromagnetic fields, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the quantum hardware design. 

By inducing faults, attackers can alter quantum states or computational processes, potentially leading to incorrect results or revealing sensitive information



9. Quantum Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack 

Quantum denial-of-service (DoS) attacks involve flooding a quantum computer or quantum network with a high volume of requests, overloading processing capabilities, or exploiting specific vulnerabilities in quantum algorithms and hardware.

The goal is to render a quantum system inaccessible or to significantly degrade its performance, thereby preventing legitimate users from executing quantum computations.


10. Quantum Data Eavesdropping
Quantum data eavesdropping attacks involve intercepting and analyzing the transmission of quantum data to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. 

In this type of attack, adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in quantum communication channels such as those used in quantum key distribution (QKD). 

By measuring the transmitted quantum states, attackers can attempt to reconstruct the data or keys being exchanged, thereby posing a significant threat to the security of quantum communication



11. Quantum Bit-Flipping Attack 
Quantum bit-flipping attacks involve deliberately changing the state of qubits within a quantum system to disrupt its normal operation and compromise the integrity of the computations.

In this attack, an adversary manipulates the qubits by flipping their states from 0 to 1, or vice versa.

This can lead to incorrect results in quantum computations or can corrupt the information being processed, thereby posing a significant threat to the reliability and security of quantum systems.


12. Quantum Error Correction Mechanism Exploitation
Quantum error correction mechanism exploitation involves attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in error-correction protocols in quantum computing systems to introduce undetected errors that compromise the reliability of quantum computations and potentially extract sensitive information.

This can be achieved by sending tailored error patterns that error correction algorithms cannot effectively handle, leading to computational failures


13. Quantum Replay Attack
Quantum Replay Attack involves the interception and retransmission of quantum communication signals to deceive the receiver and accept them as legitimate. 

In such attacks, adversaries capture quantum data or quantum key distribution (QKD) transmissions and replay them to trick the system into thinking that the data are original and valid.

This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or compromises of the cryptographic keys.
