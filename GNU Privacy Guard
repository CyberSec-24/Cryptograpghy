GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) is a software replacement of PGP and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard that is used to encrypt and decrypt data. 

GPG is also called a hybrid encryption software program, as it uses both symmetric-key cryptography and asymmetric-key cryptography for improved speed and secure key exchange, which is achieved using the receiver’s public key for encrypting the session key.

GPG also supports S/MIME and Secure Shell (SSH). 

The latest version of GPG supports most cryptographic functions such as elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA, ECDH, and EdDSA), and it also supports the cryptography library Libgcrypt



▪ GPG Encryption
o GPG encrypts messages individually by using asymmetric-key pairs.

o The user sends the raw file, and GPG is used for signing the file using the sender’s private key for confirming the file content at the time of signing.

o Then, the file is encrypted using the receiver’s public key. Now, the file can be decrypted only with the receiver’s private key.

o After encrypting the data, the encrypted file can be stored locally, distributed to the FTP servers, or sent to email recipients



▪ GPG Decryption 
o GPG decryption is the reverse process of GPG encryption.

o As the asymmetric-key pairs are used, GPG searches for the receiver’s private key for decrypting the file.

o Signature verification is done automatically by the GPG using the sender’s public key after the decryption
