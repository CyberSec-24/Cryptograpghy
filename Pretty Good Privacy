Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a protocol used to encrypt and decrypt data with authentication and cryptographic privacy.

It is often used for data compression, digital signing, encryption and decryption of messages, emails, files, and directories, and to enhance the privacy of email communications. 

The algorithm used for message encryption is RSA for key transport and IDEA for bulk-message encryption. 

PGP uses RSA for computing digital signatures and MD5 for computing message digests. 

It combines the best features of both conventional (around 1,000 times faster than public-key encryption) and
public-key cryptography (solution to key distribution and data transmission issues) and is thereby, known as a hybrid cryptosystem


▪ PGP Encryption
o When a user encrypts data with PGP, PGP first compresses the data.

Compressing the data reduces patterns in the plaintext that could be exploited by most cryptanalysis techniques to crack the cipher, thereby increasing the resistance to cryptanalysis considerably.

o PGP then creates a random key (GSkAQk49fPD2h) that is a one-time-only secret key.

o PGP uses the random key generated to encrypt the plaintext, resulting in a ciphertext. 

o Once the data is encrypted, a random key is encrypted with the recipient’s public key.

o The public-key-encrypted random key (Td7YuEkLg99Qd0) is sent along with the ciphertext to the recipient.



 PGP Decryption 
o Decryption works in reverse.

o The recipient’s copy of PGP uses his or her private key instead of the public key to recover the temporary random key.

o PGP then uses the recovered random key to decrypt the conventionally encrypted ciphertext
